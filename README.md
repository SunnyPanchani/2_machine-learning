# üß† Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects by **Sunny Panchani**, focused on solving real-world problems using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Each project demonstrates end-to-end workflows including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment-ready apps.
